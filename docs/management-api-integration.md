# Iket Management API Integration Guide

This guide explains how to integrate and secure the management API of the Iket API Gateway, including the use of `iket` for secure remote administration via mTLS.

## Overview

The Iket Management API provides REST endpoints and WebSocket connections for:
- Gateway status monitoring
- Plugin management (enable/disable/config)
- Service and Route configuration
- Real-time metrics and logs
- Configuration reloading

All management operations are secured by default using **mTLS (Mutual TLS)** and **HTTP Basic Authentication**.

---

## 🔒 Security Configuration

### 1. Enable mTLS in Gateway

To secure the management endpoints, you must configure TLS and client certificate verification in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
security:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certFile: "/app/certs/server.crt"
    keyFile: "/app/certs/server.key"
    clientCAFile: "/app/certs/ca.crt"
    clientAuthType: "RequireAndVerifyClientCert" # MANDATORY for secure admin
  
  enableBasicAuth: true
  basicAuthUsers:
    admin: "your-secure-password"
```

### 2. Management Authentication Flow

1. **Transport Layer**: The client must provide a certificate signed by the `clientCAFile` configured on the server.
2. **Application Layer**: The client must provide valid Basic Auth credentials (username/password) defined in `basicAuthUsers`.

---

## 🛠️ Administrative Tool: `iket`

The `iket` client is the recommended way to interact with the Management API. It handles the mTLS handshake and credential management automatically.

### Installation
```bash
# Using the ultimate installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhangun/iket/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Configuration (`cli-config.yaml`)
`iket` manages its settings in `~/.iket/cli-config.yaml`. The easiest way to configure it is via the guided setup:
```bash
iket setup
```

Alternatively, you can manage multiple **Contexts** manually:
```bash
# Add a remote production context
iket context add prod \
  --url https://api.yourdomain.com:8443 \
  --ca ~/.iket/certs/ca.crt \
  --cert ~/.iket/certs/client.crt \
  --key ~/.iket/certs/client.key
```

## API Endpoints

All Management API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.

### Gateway Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/gateway/status` | Get gateway health, uptime, and request stats |
| GET | `/api/v1/gateway/config` | Get current configuration (secrets redacted) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/gateway/config` | Update gateway configuration |
| POST | `/api/v1/gateway/reload` | Trigger a hot-reload of services and routes |

### Service & Route Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/services` | List all services and their defined routes |
| POST | `/api/v1/services` | Register a new service definition |
| PUT | `/api/v1/services/{id}` | Update an existing service |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/services/{id}` | Remove a service |
| POST | `/api/v1/routes/{id}/enable` | Enable a specific route |
| POST | `/api/v1/routes/{id}/disable` | Disable a specific route |

### Plugin Management

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/plugins` | List all active and available plugins |
| PUT | `/api/v1/plugins/{name}/config` | Update a plugin's global configuration |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/{name}/enable` | Enable a plugin globally |
| POST | `/api/v1/plugins/{name}/disable` | Disable a plugin globally |

---

## Programmatic Integration (Go)

If you are building a custom management dashboard in Go, use the `APIClient` provided in the Iket package.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/bhangun/iket/pkg/api_client" // Use the provided client
)

func main() {
    // Initialize secure client
    client, err := api_client.NewAPIClient(
        "https://iket-server:8080",
        false,                      // skipVerify
        "/path/to/ca.crt",
        "/path/to/client.crt",
        "/path/to/client.key",
    )
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Call management endpoints
    status, err := client.Do("GET", "/api/v1/gateway/status", nil)
    fmt.Println(string(status))
}
```

## WebSocket for Real-time Monitoring

Iket provides WebSockets for real-time streaming of events and metrics.

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/logs/stream` | Stream server logs in real-time |
| `/api/v1/metrics/system` | Get live system resource usage (CPU/Mem) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. "TLS handshake error: remote error: tls: bad certificate"
- **Cause**: The client did not provide a certificate, or the certificate is not signed by the CA configured in `clientCAFile`.
- **Solution**: Ensure your `cli-config.yaml` points to the correct `cert_file` and `key_file`.

### 2. "401 Unauthorized"
- **Cause**: mTLS succeeded, but the Basic Auth credentials provided in the header are invalid.
- **Solution**: Check your `basicAuthUsers` in the server `config.yaml`.

### 3. "Connection refused"
- **Cause**: The server is not listening on the expected port or TLS is not enabled.
- **Solution**: Verify the `port` and `security.tls.enabled` settings in `config.yaml`.
